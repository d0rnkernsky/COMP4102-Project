Title:  Panorama creation and with subsequent manual object removal

Summary: The ultimate goal of this project is to create a tool that can produce panoramas from 4-5 images. Subsequently, a user will be able to choose an object to remove from the panorama. This project will work with two computer vision problems (1) image stitching to produce a panorama and (2) inpainting. 

Background:

The Challenge:  

Goals and Deliverables: 
The ultimate goal of this project is a program capable of producing a panorama image by combining several images (4-5) of the same scene. Additionally, the program will provide users with an object removal from the scene feature. The users will be able to upload several images of a scene into the program, create a panorama and manually select a contour of the object to be removed from the scene. The removed object spot will be inpainted with a suitable background. 

Extra goals include extending panorama generation in more than one direction. Traditional panorama creation tools allow horizontal or vertical panoramas. Another possible extension is to create a mobile application with the same functionality that can work with limited computational resources.

// How realistic is it for your team to get what it needs to get done within theallotted time?  Remember you only have a few weeks to get this projectcompleted

The project evaluation is be based on several rubrics:
1) Correct and seamless panorama creation
2) Correct and seamless object removal
3) Correct background inpainting at the removed object spot
